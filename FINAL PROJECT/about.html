        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The project is designed to save energy by automatically managing the lights in a classroom environment. It uses a PIR motion sensor to detect when someone enters the room, and a relay module controls the light. Notifications can be sent to the owner when the light is turned on or off, and there are scheduling features for automated control.</p>
